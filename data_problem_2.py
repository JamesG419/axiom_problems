#Write a generic function to compute various scenarios for the following optimization problem: A farmer owns X acres of land. 
# She profits P1 dollars per acre of corn and P2 dollars per acre of oats. Her team has Y hours of labor available. 
# The corn takes H1 hours of labor per acre and oats require H2 hours of labor per acre. 
# How many acres of each can be planted to maximize profits?
#Test the function for the following cases:
#a) X = 240, Y = 320, P1 = $40, P2 = $30, H1 = 2, H2 = 1
#b) X = 300, Y = 380, P1 = $70, P2 = $45, H1 = 3, H2 = 1
#c) X = 180, Y = 420, P1 = $65, P2 = $55, H1 = 3, H2 = 2
